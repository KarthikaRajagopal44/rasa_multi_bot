# Rasa chatbot example
This is an example bilingual rasa chatbot implementation that can be connected to your Facebook page using chatfuel.

Chatfuel comes with a bunch of features one of which is providing a messenger channel to receive messages from facebook along with other attributes including what we need, userâ€™s profile language. It also gives you a nice get started button so you can provide a nice welcome message for the user. Chatfuel also provides a backend integration webhook namely JSON API to pass the user message to the Rasa servers that i am running in my backend. Goal is to interpret the message from Chatfuel and provide a response back
